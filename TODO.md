# TODO

A place to keep to-dos of the PyTorch tutorials re-write.

* Rewrite introductory text on [index.rst](index.rst).
* Move 60 minute blitz section "front and center" or show individual tutorials.
* Add "Learning Objectives" to all tutorials

* Remove extra tutorials from "Getting Started"

    * 60 minute blitz
        * Math section in autograd tutorial - mark as optional - maybe make a manual derivative example
        * Explicity mark data_parallel as optional
        * Fixes from https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/issues/534
    * Rename "Data Loading and Preprocessing" as "Defining a Custom DataLoader".
        * If we keep this one, need to update path to file, include better download instructions.
    * Move to `examples/recipes`
    
    * Learning PyTorch with Examples - move to `examples/recipes`.
